            <small>a UX & UI research and design concept</small></h1>
        
            <p class='lead'>A concept derived from a conversation about leading a minimalist lifestyle by buying and wasting less, and the merits of organisations that allow the lending of "things", while reminiscing of the stories we had heard of the previous generation where neighbourhood lending and borrowing was common place. This is a personal project that I worked on alone.</p>

                        <li>Availability: Throughout NZ - end users can choose to rent locally, or from venders who can deliver to their city.</li>
                        <li>Products: All lot of different products, but mainly listed by already established rental companies. Also allows the option of requesting items to rent.</li>
                        <li>My thoughts: The site is very cluttered, with a lot of information. It doesn't give the impression of being very active, and looks to be more a catalogue for rental companies. This would be great for hosting an event (it even has a planner to allow you to organise all the rental items for an event), as it would allow you to see different products from a range of rental companies.</li>

                        <li>My thoughts: This concept is very similar to what I have, and if it was available in my country it would be a good alternative. The interface example given on the website looked really clean and easy to use, and the set up appeared very simple and straight forward. This app allows renters to ask owners questions, and allows cancelling at any time leading up to the product exchange. End users can search by the map to see whats local, by category, or keyword. Renters and owners can give feedback on each other.</li>

                        <li> My thoughts: This is the organisation that inspired the conversation I originally had and the concept. It seems fairly straightforward to use this system, and it ties into the library membership which makes it free. They do have a limited selection and are reliant on government funding to buy new items or on donations from the public to increase their inventory. They also have a lending agreement and a minimal age limit.</li>

            <h2 class='header'>Prototype</h2>
            <p>I really enjoyed this project and got thoroughly immersed in it.</p>
            <p>In the final prototype, I tweaked the design quite a bit - I think this could have been avoided if I had consulted more people at all stages of the process. I removed the link names from the navigation bar to keep the design clean, and the names needed to be small to fit in, which would mean they wouldn't be very visible anyway. I chose the icons I did to be straightforward enough not to need the text - the only one I am not sure about is the "inventory" or "my stuff" icon, which I used an open book with a bookmark in it.</p>
            <p>I had overlooked the need for a home button, so that the end user could get back to the "Community Page", which is essentially their news feed. I moved the navigation bar to the bottom of the screen for easier use. I did A/B testing on whether the icons should be highlighted if you were in that location of the app, but I found it unnecessarily distracting.</p>
            <p>Testing this on my phone through the Principle mirroring app, almost all my text is way too small to be easily read on a phone - the individual items page, the conversation view, and the request form. Next time I would split the form into two screens, as I think keeping it all on one page will risk the end user not scrolling down to see all the fields.</p>
            <p>I like the colouring, but I think the pricing for the items is not contrasted enough to be visible. I would try this in the next edit to a pink button with the pale text inside in bold - still strong enough to get attention, and with enough contrast to be easier to see. On the same note, I originally liked the "clean" look of the messaging screen, but seeing it in the tests on my phone, there needs to be more contrasting colour blocks - I don't think the conversation speech bubbles stand out enough, and don't make it obvious what the conversation parts are.</p>

I would like to continue to work on this project to see how far I can get it.</p>
